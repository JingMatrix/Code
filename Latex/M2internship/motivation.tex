	\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

	My name is Jianyu MA and I am an M2 student in fundamental mathematics.

	In my undergraduate, I spent most time on differential geometry and probability theory. They were insightful for me to grasp real world through abstraction. I was always hoping that I could do research connecting these two fields to explore more of what I enjoyed. My M1 internship was about stochastic calculus.
	I was extremely motivated as I was facing opportunities of contributing to what had attracted me for a long time.
	After finished it, the only thing stopped me from going further was the absence of geometry.
	To follow closely my heart, I chose fundamental mathematics as my M2 RI program in Université Paul Sabatier.

	Fortunately, later I found optimal transportation an ideal field deeply involving what I am interested in. This filed got high attention and well developed twenty years ago. Hence my advisor Jérome Bertrand, a geometer who shared same research interests as me, suggested a recent topic ``barycenter".
	We finally set our goal to build central limit theorems in terms of barycenter; this would be a nice return to probability theory.

	Our project will serve as a cornerstone for wide applications in statistics. And it is promising to get inspirations once we dig into mature theories of optimal transportation and convex analysis. Therefore, I would like to apply for the thesis grant at IMT under supervision of Jérome Bertrand with title ``\emph{Barycenter and central limit theorem}".

	I have been in Toulouse for two years, and I wish that I could stay here for the beginning of my academic career.
	Our department is near both to Canal du Midi and Pech-David with delightful landscape.
	Moreover, there is a wonderful library with  warm-hearted staffs and huge collection of interesting books.
	I also appreciate teachers in our institute as they give courses with high responsibility and patience.
	During this Covid-19 confinement, I am benefiting from various social aids such as food distribution for students.
	I feel grateful and hopeful for living in such a warm city.
	This is exactly the society I am expecting for my life.

	Thanks for reading this motivation letter. I am terribly excited expecting your help for the thesis grant.
	\closing{Yours sincerely,}
