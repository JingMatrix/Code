abstract = {We study barycenters in the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold, equipped with the Wasserstein metric. Under reasonable assumptions, we establish absolute continuity of the barycenter of general measures Ω∈P(P(M)) on Wasserstein space, extending on one hand, results in the Euclidean case (for barycenters between finitely many measures) of Agueh and Carlier [1] to the Riemannian setting, and on the other hand, results in the Riemannian case of Cordero-Erausquin, McCann, Schmuckenschläger [12] for barycenters between two measures to the multi-marginal setting. Our work also extends these results to the case where Ω is not finitely supported. As applications, we prove versions of Jensen's inequality on Wasserstein space and a generalized Brunn–Minkowski inequality for a random measurable set on a Riemannian manifold.}
