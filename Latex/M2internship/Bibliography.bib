	abstract="We are now ready to move on to the local and global geometry of Riemannian manifolds. The main tool for this will be the important concept of geodesics. These curves will help us define and understand Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces. One is led quickly to two types of ``completeness''. The first is of standard metric completeness, and the other is what we call geodesic completeness, namely, when all geodesics exist for all time. We shall prove the Hopf-Rinow Theorem, which asserts that these types of completeness for a Riemannian manifold are equivalent. Using the metric structure makes it possible to define metric distance functions. We shall study when these distance functions are smooth and show the existence of the smooth distance functions introduced in chapter 3 We also classify complete simply connected manifolds of constant curvature; showing that they are the ones we have already constructed in chapters 1 and 4",

abstract = {We study barycenters in the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold, equipped with the Wasserstein metric. Under reasonable assumptions, we establish absolute continuity of the barycenter of general measures Ω∈P(P(M)) on Wasserstein space, extending on one hand, results in the Euclidean case (for barycenters between finitely many measures) of Agueh and Carlier [1] to the Riemannian setting, and on the other hand, results in the Riemannian case of Cordero-Erausquin, McCann, Schmuckenschläger [12] for barycenters between two measures to the multi-marginal setting. Our work also extends these results to the case where Ω is not finitely supported. As applications, we prove versions of Jensen's inequality on Wasserstein space and a generalized Brunn–Minkowski inequality for a random measurable set on a Riemannian manifold.}
