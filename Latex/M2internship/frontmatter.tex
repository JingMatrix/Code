\section*{Acknowledgement}

This report is under the supervision of Dr \href{https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~bertrand/}{Jérôme Bertrand}. I would like to express my appreciation for his tolerance and warm-hearted help during this M2 internship. I feel fortunate to find and explore this interesting topic of barycenter with him.

For technical help in editing \LaTeX\, source code I am glad and grateful to live in a world with open-source projects like \href{https://www.vim.org/}{vim} and \href{https://github.com/lervag/vimtex}{vimtex}.
Also I should mention \href{https://mathpix.com/}{mathpix}, which enables me to copy or plagiarize \LaTeX\, code from published papers.

Finally, it was the company from my friends that helped me go out of depression and rendered me a colourful life.
Especially, I would like to thank Alonso Herrera and Ziwei Tang.
