\section*{\centering{Acknowledgements}}

This report was made under the supervision of Dr \href{https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~bertrand/}{Jérôme Bertrand}.
I would like to express my appreciation for his tolerance and warm-hearted help during this M2 internship.
He gave me the main direction of this report and lots of useful advices and ideas.
I feel fortunate to find and explore this interesting topic of barycenter with him.

For technical help in editing \LaTeX\, source code I am glad and grateful to live in a world with open-source projects like \href{https://www.vim.org/}{vim} and \href{https://github.com/lervag/vimtex}{vimtex}.
Also I should mention \href{https://mathpix.com/}{mathpix}, which enables me to copy or plagiarize \LaTeX\, code from published papers.

Finally, it was the company of my friends that helped me to go out of depression and rendered me a colourful life.
Especially, I would like to thank to Alonso Herrera and Ziwei Tang.
